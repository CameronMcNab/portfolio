                <p>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>
                    My interest in IT is endless, taking courses on and self-teaching countless field-related topics just for my own enjoyment. Initially I began following a professional career in tech when I left high school in year 10 after designing and programming a video game portfolio and gaining acceptance into the AIE. This was many years before receiving my ADHD diagnosis and so unfortunately class-based learning never worked out. Now, as an adult and with a bit more life experience under my belt, I’m ready to begin pursuing my true passion again.

            <div class="question">
                <p>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>I chose RMIT purely for the ability to complete an online pathways program, as it allows me to continue my full-time electrical work which provides for my family and zoo of animals. Eventually I would love to gain entrance to a local (Queensland) online Computer Science degree, however the options for a school leaving tradie are limited so it’s the long way for me!</p>

                <p>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>I’m hoping to gain more of an understanding surrounding what the IT/tech field entails in the real world. I believe I know which rough end goal I’m aiming for, and I hope to gain the basic tools, skills, and knowledge to start me on my path!</p>
