                <p>My product “BoardGamers” (no trademark in AU) is an app designed to provide boardgame players with a tool to not only track their results, high scores, and strategies, but also to integrate their data into a global boardgame community. While BoardGamers is accessible and usable by everyone, our product is aiming to target the enthusiast to professional level of player, where regular sessions and competitive/repeated play will be a factor.</p>
                <p>The number of photos and notes on my phone that act as references during my regular boardgame nights is frustratingly large, slowing down set-up times and creating more work and confusion for what should be a fun and social experience. This is where my tool BoardGamers comes in, providing a centralised location to easily record and compare all facets of your gaming escapades. Having immediate access to photos of previous games, your notes on strategies, other users’ tips, and the connectivity of creating separate groups for any of your gaming needs – board game nights have never been easier.</p>
                <P>Getting into specifics, BoardGamers will allow players to organise their gaming information and find board gaming groups through access to a mix of free and paid tools. These tools will be broken into menus available from a side panel, as well as a main page that displays configurable information from any element of the menus. The overarching aim of the application is to bring simplicity into accessing required information, and so these menus will be very direct and straight forward. These will be separated into – </P>
                <p><strong>Games –</strong> Displays a list of board game groupings, with “Active” games displayed first, “Favourite” games displayed second, “Previously Played” games displayed third, and “Recommended Titles” displayed fourth. Played games can be tapped on to see your previous results, notes, strategies, and your pictures of games as well as a brief game description. Recommended games can be tapped to see a brief game description, prices from retailers, and reviews/ratings from other players. Both will display global high scores and leader boards.</p>
                <p><strong>Groups -</strong> Displays active, previous, and available social groups with configurable sub menus/nicknames for joined groups (Friends, School, Thursday Night Group, etc). At the top will be a filter list to sort groups by games, upcoming events/game nights, online members, member numbers, and groups you have marked as active/favourite/previous. Once a group has been selected the user can see the group members, calendar, notice board, group specific chat box, group leader board, active and previous games as well as group specific results/high scores, and notification settings for the group. People can choose the availability and visibility of their BoardGamers group and profile to prevent or enable people to find you through the Groups search function – BoardGamers is all about having fun with whoever you choose!</p>
                <p><strong>Calendar -</strong>Displays a user specific calendar containing configurable information with options including upcoming group and BoardGamers hosted events, game releases, local and global tournaments and competitions, and any user created events (with choices for notifications, whole day or set times, and repeating weekly/monthly/yearly etc). Each of these types of events can have notifications, colour coding, and importance scaling applied.</p>
                <p><strong>BoardGamers –</strong> Displays all BoardGamers related information which may be helpful or interesting to users. This includes our “BoardGamers Game of The Month” recommendation, various “Top xx” lists (including “Top Played”, “Top Rated”, “Top Searched”), descriptions of BoardGamers hosted events, BoardGamers team and sponsors, links to relevant social medias, links to helpful/tutorial style information regarding the application itself, and of course a link to the BoardGamers legal information.</p>
                <p><strong>Account & Settings –</strong>This is where users can change their general visibility settings, profile picture/avatar, app colour scheme, online status for individual groups, account login/password/display name, general notification settings, and any other account or settings related options.</p>
                <p><strong>Contact Us -</strong>The final sidebar option, this will lead to a form users can fill out including a subject, heading, body, and a drop-down menu stating why they’re contacting us to assist in prioritising and organising users’ submissions. The options include “Technical Problems”, “Suggestions & Critiques”, “Questions”, and “Other”. These will be submitted to a BoardGamers email and automatically organised into based off the selected drop-down menu option.</p>
                <p>The tools and technology used to create BoardGamers will be dependent on my VERY limited understanding of IT/programming and will be aimed at deployment onto Android devices. So far, the application itself will be programmed using Java in the Android Studio IDE, and for database and server tools and management I’ll be using Google’s “Firebase”. Firebase is designed for the exact applications I would be using it for, allowing easy user identification/log-in, storage for any user created/inputted data, website and server hosting, and live updating without needing to republish. These tools are all designed to be efficient and user friendly, and after much research and learning I believe I will be able to use these effectively to create BoardGamers.</p>
                <p>The skills required to create my product are beyond my current capabilities, however creating an early prototyped version of BoardGamers is most certainly within grasp after some time is spent learning the required software and skills. All the tools I’ve chosen are easily accessible and have many educational resources available, as well as being designed at their core to give developers an easy and efficient workflow. Android device emulation is included in Android Studio, and so development can be localised on my computer without the need for external hardware/software, and beyond that the only requirements at the edge will be and Android compatible device – which there are currently 2.8 billion users of.</p>
                <p>Throughout the design of BoardGamers the focus will, of course, be on allowing board game enthusiasts to streamline their board game nights, as well as connect with like-minded individuals. With the features thus far included in my design brief, I believe this goal will be achieved. The current development tools and design will allow for endless additions and progression as the needs of users and the application develop. All of this combined will make BoardGamers an easy, streamlined, assistance tool to every user, solving the issues and frustrations that we as players have experienced.</p>
